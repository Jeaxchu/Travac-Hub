We are united under the umbrella, this illusion that we have so carefully crafted in our dreams- Or was it just mine? Oh how your eyes gleam in the night, they fill the sky with a thousand- No, a billion stars. They are bright and can be seen from miles afar from our earth- Our home. My heart",
  "You may find this absurd or even weird but I think of you when I need to sleep. I don't need sleep as I need you. I want you. I love you.

I love you all that I have, and all that I can give",
  "if life was a deck of cards i will call you the queen of my heart",
  "I look up into the cosmos at night and see an endless array of beautiful stars and galaxies. i look out over the forested valley and see an incredible collaboration of color. i have seen so many beautiful things in my life and yet none so beautiful, none so colorful, none so encapturing and awe inspiring as the sight I saw the moment I set my eyes on you, gods finest creation. when the Greeks created aphrodite they must have been thinking of you. i would give the world over to spend a fraction of a second to merely look at you, for that fractioned second would stay expanding in my heart with each pump, your image pulled closer at each contraction. Not a moment goes by where my heart does not long for your touch. my skin creeps with excitement at every thought, and my mind degenerates with every waking moment; i shall not focus unless it be on you, i shall not think of anything else lest i lose even a minute fraction of your delicacy. God must be real, your existence proves so to be true, no other being could have made someone of such elegance and grace, no other being could have created a creature of such exact beauty and charm. I pray every night so as to not allow such a thing to leave this life, as to have such a catastrophy would leave the world gray, desolate, incomplete and barren. A world not worth living in",

Distance may keep me from you, but my endeavors shall never go unnoticed as i claw and crawl my way to you",
